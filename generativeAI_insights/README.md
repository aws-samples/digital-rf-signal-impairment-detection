# Generative AI Solution for Digital RF Signal Impairment Detection

This solution path leverages **generative AI** to analyze constellation plots for detecting noise and impairment causes in digital RF signals. The approach combines automated DIFI packet processing with Amazon Bedrock's multimodal AI capabilities to provide intelligent signal analysis without requiring traditional machine learning model training.

## Solution Architecture

The generative AI solution consists of two main components that work together to create an end-to-end pipeline:

```
PCAP Files → DIFI_Processor → Constellation Diagrams → Bedrock_Insights → AI Analysis
```

### 🔄 [DIFI_Processor](./DIFI_Processor/)

**Converts PCAP files of DIFI packets into constellation diagrams**

- **Input**: PCAP files containing Digital Intermediate Frequency Interoperability (DIFI) standard packets
- **Processing**: Serverless AWS Lambda function that extracts I/Q data from DIFI packets
- **Output**: Constellation plot images optimized for AI analysis
- **Benefits**:
  - Serverless and scalable processing
  - Event-driven S3 triggers
  - Independent compute isolation
  - Cost-effective pay-per-use model

### 🧠 [Bedrock_Insights](./Bedrock_Insights/)

**Uses Amazon Bedrock generative AI to analyze constellation plots**

- **Input**: Constellation diagram images from DIFI_Processor
- **Processing**: Amazon Bedrock Agent with Claude Sonnet 4.5 multimodal LLM
- **Output**: Intelligent analysis of signal impairments, causes, and recommendations
- **Benefits**:
  - No model training required
  - Few-shot learning with example images
  - Knowledge base integration (RAG)
  - Natural language explanations

## Key Advantages of the Generative AI Approach

### 🚀 **No Training Required**

Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, this solution uses pre-trained generative AI models that can analyze constellation plots immediately without requiring:

- Large training datasets
- Model development and tuning
- Specialized ML expertise
- Compute-intensive training processes

### 🎯 **Few-Shot Learning**

The system uses few-shot prompting with example constellation images to guide the AI model's analysis, enabling accurate impairment detection with minimal setup.

### 📚 **Knowledge Base Integration**

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances analysis by incorporating technical documentation about RF impairments, providing contextual and accurate explanations.

### 🔍 **Multimodal Analysis**

Claude Sonnet 4.5's vision capabilities enable direct analysis of constellation plot images, identifying patterns that indicate specific impairments like:

- Phase noise (rotational smearing)
- Interference (random scattering)
- Compression (amplitude distortion)
- Normal signal characteristics
